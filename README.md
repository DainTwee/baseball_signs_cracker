# baseball_signs_cracker

Pattern recognition software specifically for cracking steal signs during baseball games.

#### Dependencies
N/A

#### How to Use
Input a code sequence (assigning characters to movements).

Then input whether the sequence represented a steal or not.

Repeat until the game ends, once a steal has been recorded the code should begin making predictions about whether a given sign is a steal or not.


Enter "steal" as the sign to see a list of all steal signs.

Enter "no steal" as the sign to see a list of all non steal signs.

Enter "qq" to quit.


Currently only works for signs that use an indicator followed by the steal sign.

#### Future Improvements
- Add AI so it works for other types of signs.
- Work for other types of signs (bunt, hit and run, delayed steal, etc)
